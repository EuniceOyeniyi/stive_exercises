    "+The easiest way to load image data is with `datasets.ImageFolder` from `torchvision` ([documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder)). In general you'll use `ImageFolder` like so:\n",

    "dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path/to/data', transform=transform)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `'path/to/data'` is the file path to the data directory and `transform` is a list of processing steps built with the [`transforms`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) module from `torchvision`. ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed like so:\n",
    "```\n",

    "root/dog/xxz.png\n",

    "root/cat/asd932_.png\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where each class has it's own directory (`cat` and `dog`) for the images. The images are then labeled with the class taken from the directory name. So here, the image `123.png` would be loaded with the class label `cat`. You can download the dataset already structured like this [from here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/Cat_Dog_data.zip). They are already splitted into a training set and test set.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    ">**Exercise:** Download the dataset and place the train and test set in the `datasets/cat_vs_dog` folder. If you're cloning this from github, you should have it in `../datasets/`. So first create the `cat_vs_dog` folder in `datasets` and verify that the data are there by running `ls ../datasets/cat_vs_dog` (or your custom path if you changed it)."

    "Great! Now that you have downloaded your data, you need to define the transformations to be passed to the `ImageFolder` function.

    "\n",
    "When you load in the data with `ImageFolder`, you'll need to define some transforms. For example, the images are different sizes but we'll need them to all be the same size for training. You can either resize them with `transforms.Resize()` or crop with `transforms.CenterCrop()`, `transforms.RandomResizedCrop()`, etc. We'll also need to convert the images to PyTorch tensors with `transforms.ToTensor()`. Typically you'll combine these transforms into a pipeline with `transforms.Compose()`, which accepts a list of transforms and runs them in sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in the other notebook, you can use the following transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomRotation(30),\n",
    "                                       transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224),\n",

    "                                       transforms.Normalize([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], \n",
    "                                                            [0.5, 0.5, 0.5])])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING!** Remember that transformation are super useful for \"augmenting\" your training data, so that you make your network less vulnerable to different sizes, rotations, or cropping. However, when you are on the test data, there is no need of augmenting the data! Actually, it is not a good practice to do that because there would be very repetitive test data that invalidates your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, define two different transformations for training and test data (remember that `ToTensor()` and normalization are necessary also for the test data, as well as the resizing (you can use `transforms.Resize(size)` for it):\n",
